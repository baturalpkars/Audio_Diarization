# Audio Diarization

This repository is an ongoing project focused on **audio diarization**, with an emphasis on building, experimenting with, and evaluating pipelines for analyzing and segmenting audio recordings.

## Project Overview

The goal of this repository is to explore methods for:
- Processing and preparing audio data
- Extracting relevant audio features
- Applying diarization-related techniques to segment and analyze speakers or audio events
- Evaluating results using appropriate metrics and tools

At this stage, the repository primarily serves as a **development and experimentation space**, where different approaches, libraries, and configurations can be tested and refined.

## Current Status

So far, the work in this repository includes:
- Initial project setup and structure
- Integration of external audio processing tools and code
- Early experimentation with audio analysis and scoring utilities
- Establishing a reproducible environment for future experiments

The codebase is expected to evolve significantly as the project progresses.

## Future Directions

Planned or potential next steps include:
- Refining the diarization pipeline
- Improving preprocessing and feature extraction
- Systematic evaluation and comparison of different approaches
- Documentation and examples for running experiments

## Notes

This repository is a work in progress. The structure, scope, and implementation details may change as the project develops.
